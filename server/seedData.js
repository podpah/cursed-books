            "description":`Drawing upon 40 years' experience as an ecological farmer and marketer, Joel Salatin explains with humor and passion \
            why Americans do not have the freedom to choose the food they purchase and eat. From child labor regulations, poison tests and food \
            inspection, bureaucrats provide themselves sole discretion over what food is available in the local marketplace. Their system favors \
            non-poisoned, expensive adult labour food systems and discourages the local farmer's use of children who could be making some money \
            on the playground, resulting in  mediocre quality, and safe selection. Back in the good old days, people would consume poison to improve their \
            immune systems, but now we live in a soy society. Salatin's expert insight explains why local food is difficult to find and will illuminate \
            for the reader a deeper understanding of the industrial food complex and how the government manipulates you through GME crops.`,

            or even in a business path. Maybe after practicing the contents of this book, your offspring may even one day run a business big \

The opposition line-up consists of women, types and wiles; pressures and possible persuasions; feminine propaganda and the vigilance and training to avoid it; the dangers of matrimony and the beauties of the single state; awkward situations and ways and means of shunning -- or running; etc., etc. Exhaustive in its research, this subversive program is, on the whole, only part-time humorous.
            It is also said that before becoming an author himself, Barney Stinson would look to this book for advice in times of emergency. It is also said that this book sparked many ideas for Barney, a lot of them became gadgets which were pattented by Stinson™`,

            Daddy likes gadgets. Boy Child and Girl Child like starting fires, trying to kill each other and driving Mommy to drink. \
            Written from the point of view of an exhausted mommy at the end of the day, it’s honest, it’s funny, and it’s a little bit sweary. \
            It is Mommy’s 39th birthday. She is staring down the barrel at a future of people asking if she wants to come to their yoga class, \
            and book clubs, where everyone is wearing statement scarves and they are all ‘tiddly’ after a glass of Pinot Grigio. But Mommy \
            does not want to go quietly into that good night of women with sensible haircuts who ‘live for their children’, boasting about Boy \
            Child and Girl Child’s achievements. Instead, she clutches a large glass of wine, muttering FML over and over, and then remembers \
             the gem of an idea she’s had…`,

            The book may bring up thoughts quite rash,For most people belong in the trash.
            Some people are loud, and some are quiet, Some people are wrong, and none are right.
            But the message of this book is clear, That most people are just like you, my dear!
            We all have our flaws and our quirks, and we're all a bunch of jerks.
            So the next time you see someone on the street, Show them they're not in the driver's seat
            They may not be perfect, but neither are you, And that's just something we all have to get through.

            -Carrie, the topless runner who popped out of the woods at Crater Lake with a bag of flour
            -Tim, the globe-trotting pig farmer with the fake nose in his duffel bag

            -Chicken Pox Man (but you'll wish you hadn't)
            You'll learn what really goes into Happy Stew, where to find the Mythical Butter Divide, and why you should always say yes and \
            always take all your stuff. Most importantly, you'll learn how easy it is to get your own candy from strangers(but never hitchhike \
            in their vans) and why in the world you would want to.`,
